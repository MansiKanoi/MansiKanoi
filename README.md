 ### Problems Faced
navigation bar was not working as in it use to cover the whole page I made the hieght of the header 
navogation bar was not moving to the section in the page i remove it by  adding javascript.designing the page  and designig grid was  a little difficult .
### Scope of imporovement
navigation bar I would have made it more responsive.i would have placed the projects page more nicely and will add links to my projects.will give a portal where in people will provide me email for reading my blogs and other feautres.
